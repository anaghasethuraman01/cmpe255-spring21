## Question

* Can we predict the diabetes status of a patient given their health measurements? Build a classifer and calculate Confusion matrix with

- True Positives (TP): we correctly predicted that they do have diabetes
- True Negatives (TN): we correctly predicted that they don't have diabetes
- False Positives (FP): we incorrectly predicted that they do have diabetes (a "Type I error")
- False Negatives (FN): we incorrectly predicted that they don't have diabetes (a "Type II error")

Try to build a number-5 detector classifier for the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset from Scikit-Learn. You can use either binary classifer or multi-classifier.
